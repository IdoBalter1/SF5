FINAL REPORT 

interim report are standard credit

the final report is graded based on. in full english no bullet points, structured in logial order.
compare to a textbook. Should have all the course notes, logically presented.
don't need to explain basic things, like graph or generator function
need to define things such as assortativity coefficient, you shouldn't assume the reader knows what you are referring to.
figure needs to be full. It needs to be recreatable. Explain how we generate the data, what are the axes. Include code as an appendix it doens't count towards page limit. 

COntent of final report:
 - complete all the exrcises in the handout.
 - don't have to do weeks 3 and 4 of high standard.
 - have to work through to understand where its going.
 - FORMULATE A QUESTION. based on material from week 3 and 4 something we think is interesting that we want to explore in more details
 -
 - How does our degree distirubtion affect the spread of a contagious disease.
 - deriving an approximaition and testing it agaisnt simulations.
 - Recommended spending a couple of hours thinking of of questions
 - focused on random graphs spreading processes.
 - WHat data and what arguemtns answer our question.
 - what wht i need to see to convince me this is true or not true.
 - what evidence would debunk this argument.
 - It will be vague, we won't prove it is always true, think about weak points int he arguemtn and why it won't completely generalise. Be your own critic, pick apart your own arguments. you haven't fully shown something you have only shown for a certain cases.
 - Run simulations and analytic arguments. Question should be ~5 pages. Question and answer can be summarised in one sentence.
 - From second week materials 
 - Introduction folllwoed buy preliminary section where it is very focused, and making it rigirous what we are asking and what we are tyring to answer, and make it rigourous what we will do to solve it. We wnat to set it up to be specific enough so that someone can recreate what we have done. THe main body of the piece will be the evidence and the discussion of the resutls. show the right figures to back up your arguments. Explain the reasoning as we go through. We have to go through the locical order to present the evidence in. One simulation might show one thing and another simulation will show another thing. explain what each evidence shows. Good to note the limitations. You want to take a line, take side note the limitations but stick to the argument.
 - CONCOLUSION - A conclusion brings together everything that has happend and brings together what has been found and what has been said and the implicaitons of the finding.
- it is not a copy of the abstract, you need to state what the limitaitons are of this and how it fits in with other things. put it inot a broader context.
- thorughout all of the sections but particualrly in the results eds to be figures, don't include too many figures. You don't need any more than 3 or 4 figures. EEvery figure that you do present should be important. it needs to back up your argument in a new way. Why am i showing this plot? the point in figures is that there are some things that are easier to show in figures than in text.
- Given the amount of time we have, its about quality not quantity.
- we don't need to show everything just becuase we can.

There will be more office hours sessions.

- it doesn't have to be novel to the literature, but novel to us.
- For the introduction - not expected to read other than anything that is covered in the notes.
- Not going to be assessed about the efficiency of the code directly. however we need to do test large networks.
- Final report is self contained. Not necessary to answer all the questions.

To do over the summer:

 - beam forming techniques for machine learnings.
 - create somethign relatively mobile, a microphone array digital to analogue. mems microphones.
 - open source data sets.
 - research papers.
 

Questions:
 - Analytic soltuion, ask him about the paper, is there someway to go further, ask for a specific guide, on how to try and prove the comoponent size decreases with increasing assortativity.
 - ask him about prerequisites - what should I explain before starting the report, assortativity coefficient, graph, adjancecy matrix etc.
 - ask him if i have made enough measurements is there any other simulation which might be worth running.
 - ask him about the limitations of the model. ( current limitations - SIR not realistic to all models. Have only shown a pattern for certain networks, not all networks. Haven't explored all values of infectino rate, have not explored dynamic edge formation hetergoneous community structure. Haven't considered the effect of how the clustering coefficient affects the assortativity coefficient.)
 - 


 Explain your finding in the introduction, results, and conclusion. Repeat
 - Explain that this only holds in certain cases but doesn't generalise to all graphs. For example it is possible to construct a counter example
 - Explain the finding of Newmann
 - Explain why you have ran certain simulatinos and how they back up your argument.
